Personal research work at labs and work 

This repository consists of work that I did during my research at Opto-Electro Structural Lab (OESL), KAIST and Robot Intelligence Technology (RIT) Lab, KAIST.

At OESL I was working on defect detection in composite material using images and time series data.
At RIT, I am working on deep learning for healthcare, specifically I am working on Alzheimer's disease classification and medical data scarcity,

Note that I took help from many resources during my research work.
