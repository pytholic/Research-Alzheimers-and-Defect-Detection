Work done during my time at Opto-Electro Structural Lab (OESL), KAIST from September 2019 to August 2020.

Description:

  • Defect detection in composite materials using ultrasonic wave propagation imaging (UWPI)
  • Defect detection and localization in composite materials using 1D signals and deep CNNs
  • Defect detection and localization using 2D images from UWPI results and deep learning
  • Defect detection in composite materials using machine learning
  • Deep Learning / CNNs
  • TensorFlow Object Detection API, Faster RCNN, RFCN, MobileNets
  • Transfer Learning
